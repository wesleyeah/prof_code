<pre>Well I'm going out west where I belong
Where the days are short and nights are long

And I'll walk and they'll walk
I'll twist and they'll twist
I'll shimmy and they'll shimmy
I'll fly and they'll fly Yeah!
Were out there havin' fun, in the warm california sun

I'm going out west out on the coast
All the california girls are really the most

And I'll walk and they'll walk
I'll twist and they'll twist
I'll shimmy and they'll shimmy
I'll fly and they'll fly Yeah!
Were out there having fun, in the warm california sun Hey!

The girls are frisky in old 'Frisco
A pretty little chick wherever you go

Woah, Woah, Woah Well I'll walk and they'll walk
I'll twist and they'll twist
I'll shimmy and they'll shimmy
I'll fly and they'll fly Yeah!
Were out there having fun, in the warm california sun

Were out there havin' fun, in the warm california sun!
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun</pre><br>

        <h2>Ramones - Can't Seem To Make You Mine</h2><br>
        <audio src="./audio/Ramones - Can't Seem to Make You Mine.mp3" controls></audio><br>

<pre>I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
You fly around like a bee
Hurtin' everything you see
I try everything I know
To make you wanna love me so
The only things you do
Is try to put the hurt on me
    
Can't you see what you're doin' to me
You fill my heart with misery
In every breath and step I take
I'm more in love with you
    
Can't go on like this
A little bit of love and not one kiss
I've gotta have your love every day
Love that's real and will stay
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
    
Can't you see...
    
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
Come back baby to me
And my misery
I give you love night and day
Never ever go away
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine</pre><br>

        <audio src="./audio/Van Halen - D.O.A.mp3" controls></audio><br>

<pre>We was broke and hungry on a summer day
They sent the sheriff down to try an' drive us away
We were sittin' ducks for the police man
They found a dirty-faced kid in a garbage can, uh ha
Ooh! And I'm alone, I'm on the highway
Wanted, dead or alive
Dead or alive
            
Broken down and dirty, dressed in rags
A-from the day my mama told me: boy, you pack your bags
A-send the mayor down in his pickup truck
The jury look at me, say: outta luck, oo-ooh, yeah!
            
And I'm alone, I'm on the highway
Wanted, dead or alive
Dead or alive, uh-aah!
            
Alright! Uh!
            
Now, I'm broken down and dirty, dressed in rag
A-from the day my mama told me: boy, you pack your bags
An' we were sittin' ducks for the police man
They found a dirty-faced kid in a garbage can
Di-yeah, yeah!
            
Babe, I'm alone and, I'm on the highway
Wanted, dead or alive
Dead or alive, ow-ow!
            
Wow! O'm gone! ooh yeah! oh
Ow-ow
            
Baby, let me run
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm a spark on the horizon</pre><br>
