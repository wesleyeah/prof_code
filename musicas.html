<pre>Well I'm going out west where I belong
Where the days are short and nights are long

And I'll walk and they'll walk
I'll twist and they'll twist
I'll shimmy and they'll shimmy
I'll fly and they'll fly Yeah!
Were out there havin' fun, in the warm california sun

I'm going out west out on the coast
All the california girls are really the most

And I'll walk and they'll walk
I'll twist and they'll twist
I'll shimmy and they'll shimmy
I'll fly and they'll fly Yeah!
Were out there having fun, in the warm california sun Hey!

The girls are frisky in old 'Frisco
A pretty little chick wherever you go

Woah, Woah, Woah Well I'll walk and they'll walk
I'll twist and they'll twist
I'll shimmy and they'll shimmy
I'll fly and they'll fly Yeah!
Were out there having fun, in the warm california sun

Were out there havin' fun, in the warm california sun!
Where they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun</pre>
